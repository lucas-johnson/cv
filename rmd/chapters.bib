	abstract = {This chapter walks through a procedure for predicting the prevalence of ``shrubland'' (defined here as low-statured vegetation between 1 and 5m in height) across a diverse region in New York State, patterned off the process used in Mahoney et al. (2022a). Due to the impacts of climate change and human land use patterns, these shrublands are becoming an increasingly important land cover type in the region, often representing an entirely novel ecosystem type. As a result of this novelty, these shrublands and the roles they play in the larger landscape (for instance, as habitats and as components of biogeochemical cycles) are poorly understood. Even identifying shrublands using remote sensing data, a potential way to monitor their development over time, is difficult given the relative rarity of shrublands in this region and their similar appearance to forest lands and wetlands in satellite imagery. The chapter introduces step-by-step how to fit a feedforward neural network using the Keras module in the popular TensorFlow package and a subset of the data from Mahoney et al. (2022a). Due to the rarity of shrubland in this region of New York, the chapter focuses on the adjustments necessary when building models from data with imbalanced classes, and on how to interpret model performance metrics when fitting classification models for specific purposes. Chapter exercises prompt learners to investigate how different priorities for a model might result in notably different performance measures.},
