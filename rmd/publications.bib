	abstract = {Understanding historical forest dynamics, specifically changes in forest biomass and carbon stocks, has become critical for assessing current forest climate benefits and projecting future benefits under various policy, regulatory, and stewardship scenarios. Carbon accounting frameworks based exclusively on national forest inventories are limited to broad-scale estimates, but model-based approaches that combine these inventories with remotely sensed data can yield contiguous fine-resolution maps of forest biomass and carbon stocks across landscapes over time. Here we describe a fundamental step in building a map-based stock-change framework: mapping historical forest biomass at fine temporal and spatial resolution (annual, 30 m) across all of New York State (USA) from 1990 to 2019, using freely available data and open-source tools. Using Landsat imagery, US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, and off-the-shelf LiDAR collections we developed three modeling approaches for mapping historical forest aboveground biomass (AGB): training on FIA plot-level AGB estimates (direct), training on LiDAR-derived AGB maps (indirect), and an ensemble averaging predictions from the direct and indirect models. Model prediction surfaces (maps) were tested against FIA estimates at multiple scales. All three approaches produced viable outputs, yet tradeoffs were evident in terms of model complexity, map accuracy, saturation, and fine-scale pattern representation. The resulting map products can help identify where, when, and how forest carbon stocks are changing as a result of both anthropogenic and natural drivers alike. These products can thus serve as inputs to a wide range of applications including stock-change assessments, monitoring reporting and verification frameworks, and prioritizing parcels for protection or enrollment in improved management programs.},

@article{Johnson2022,
	abstract = {Estimating forest aboveground biomass (AGB) at large scales and fine spatial resolutions has become increasingly important for greenhouse gas accounting, monitoring, and verification efforts to mitigate climate change. Airborne LiDAR is highly valuable for modeling attributes of forest structure including AGB, yet most LiDAR collections take place at local or regional scales covering irregular, non-contiguous footprints, resulting in a patchwork of different landscape segments at various points in time. Here, as part of a statewide forest carbon assessment for New York State (USA), we addressed common obstacles in leveraging a LiDAR patchwork for AGB mapping at landscape scales, including selection of training data, the investigation of regional or coverage specific patterns in prediction error, and map agreement with field inventory across multiple scales. Three machine learning algorithms and an ensemble model were trained with Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field measurements, airborne LiDAR, and topographic, climatic, and cadastral geodata. Using a novel set of plot selection criteria and growth adjustments to temporally align LiDAR coverages with FIA measurements, 801 FIA plots were selected with co-located point clouds drawn from a patchwork of 17 leaf-off LiDAR coverages (2014--2019). Our ensemble model was used to produce 30 m AGB prediction surfaces within a predictor-defined area of applicability (98% of LiDAR coverage) and within four vegetated landcover classes. The resulting AGB maps were compared with FIA plot-level and areal estimates at multiple scales of aggregation. Our model was overall accurate (% root mean squared error 22%--45%; mean absolute error 11.6--29.4 Mg ha-1; mean error 2.4--6.3 Mg ha-1), explained 73%--80% of field-observed variation, and yielded estimates that were largely consistent with FIA's design-based estimates (89% of estimates within FIA's 95% confidence interval). We share practical solutions to challenges faced in using spatiotemporal patchworks of LiDAR to meet growing needs for AGB prediction and mapping in support of broad-scale applications in forest carbon accounting and ecosystem stewardship.},
